An application that uses mySQL, PHP, and HTML to store vendor information. Was a practice project during academia. 

Please note that this application does not provide any security for user inputs, so this application is susceptible to SQL injections.

Within the database, the user can :
- Display vendor by name or ID.
- Display all vendors.
- Insert new vendor from user input.
- Update an exisiting vendor.
- Delete a vendor.

This application provides a very basic web interface to allow such operations.
